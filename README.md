this was also a little project for the future of being able to move windows around on your site,no matter if its on your phone or computer.
and you can also close, minimize and reopen windows as you can see when you click the login button on this page.

My inspiration came from the agenda system of my work, they had windows you could move around to remove some of the clutter but it wasn't working too well with a lot of glitches.
now i made one of my own without those glitches and in pure javascript so it isn't dependant on anything to make it work

this took 4 weeks to complete and i learnt a lot of JS to make this work.
i made this in my 3rd year of college.
